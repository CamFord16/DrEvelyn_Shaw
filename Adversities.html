<h1 style= "text-align: center;">CHALLENGES DR. EVELYN SHAW FACED</h1>
<div id= "quote" style= "text-align: center; margin-left: 80px; margin-right:80px; height: 150px;">
<p style= "margin-left: 80px;margin-right: 80px; font-size: 15px;">Dr. Evelyn Shaw was a mother, wife, and daughter of Polish immigrants. During her extensive educational career, she as a minority, faced ethinicty and gender based discrimination. Polish immigrants in America during the 1900s were discriminated based on their appearance, religion and culture.</p>

<p style= "margin-left: 80px;margin-right: 80px; font-size: 15px;">Several newspaper articles were published about Dr. Shaw. Many of them tended to talk about Dr. Shaw's physical appearance. One article called Shaw "a good-looking redheaded ichthyologist"</p>
<p style= "margin-left: 80px;margin-right: 80px; font-size: 15px;">In the 20th century, women who weren't married or were divorced were looked down upon. Many people believed that women belonged at home and that they weren't fit to be scientists. Shaw said "There's no doubt that women are edged out in research. Some professors won't accept women graduate students, believing that they will ultimately leave to marry. One professor bluntly told me to stop wasting my time". Shaw also got divorced in 1957 which was considered an obstacle that she faced.</p>
