  <p style ="height: 350px;padding: 60px; text-align: center">In "Female Strategies", Dr. Evelyn Shaw and Joan Darling examine the ways in which female animals of diverse types express their reproductive-and motherhood-mandate, explaining the vast differences between stereotypes of feminine behavior and the biological, evolutionary foundation of femininity. The New York Times described this book as humans having “wrongly imposed our own [opinion on female secuality], somewhat confused expectations of gender behavior upon animals. In reality, in many species, females are far from being sexually reluctant creatures. More often, they are aggressive, at times even ruthless, in their pursuit of the opposite sex, and frequently possess prodigious sexual appetites.”
